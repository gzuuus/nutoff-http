          <h2>About Nutoff Wallet Proxy</h2>
          <p>
            Nutoff is a proxy service that enables you to use your local nutoff
            wallet as a Lightning Address, even when running locally. The
            service bridges the gap between your local wallet (reachable via
            Nostr through contextvm) and the Lightning Network by providing an
            HTTP interface that Lightning wallets can understand and interact
            with.

          <p>
            Follow these steps to get your nutoff wallet working with the proxy:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Install and run your nutoff wallet:</strong><br />
              Visit
              <a
                href="https://github.com/gzuuus/nutoff-wallet"
                target="_blank"

                >https://github.com/gzuuus/nutoff-wallet</a
              >
              and follow the installation instructions to run your local wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Get your wallet's public key:</strong><br />
              Once your wallet is running, obtain its public key.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Create your Lightning Address:</strong><br />
              Your Lightning Address will be in the format:
              <code>pubkey...@proxy.tls</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Start receiving payments:</strong><br />
              Lightning wallets can now send payments to your address through
              the proxy.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <section class="about-proxy-section">
          <h2>About the HTTP Proxy</h2>
          <p>
            The HTTP proxy is a public service that anyone can run. The source
            code is available at
            <a
              href="https://github.com/gzuuus/nutoff-http"
              target="_blank"

              >https://github.com/gzuuus/nutoff-http</a
            >. This proxy translates between your local nutoff wallet (using
            contextvm and Nostr) and the expected API interface of a Lightning
            Address, making your locally wallet instantly reachable and usable
            through the Lightning Network.

          <h2>Security & Privacy Model</h2>
          <p>
            Your security and privacy are paramount in the Nutoff architecture.
            The proxy service has
            <strong>no access to your wallet or your nuts</strong>. All your
            funds and sensitive data remain local to your computer - there is no
            database in the proxy that stores any of your information.
          </p>
          <p>
            The proxy acts as a simple API adapter: it translates requests from
            Lightning wallets into the format your local nutoff wallet
            understands (via Nostr and contextvm), and forwards responses back.
            It never handles your private keys, sees your balances, or has
            access to your transaction history.
          </p>
          <p>Your are responsible for your own security and privacy.</p>
